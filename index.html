  <p>
    We’ve had enough of digital monopolies and surveillance capitalism. We want an alternative world that works for everyone, just like the original intention of the web and net.
    <br/>
    We seek a world of open platforms and protocols with real choices of applications and services for people. We care about privacy, transparency and autonomy. Our tools and organisations should fundamentally be accountable and resilient.

        <p>
          The internet, once hailed as a force for democracy, has allowed a handful of monoliths to amass more power than most nation states. Social media have become surveillance machines, making our interactions with technology feel exploitative. We aim to change that. Redecentralize strives for an alternative ecosystem made up of interoperable products and services build on public infrastructures. Products, moreover, that do not surveill their users, but instead protect their right to privacy.
        </p>

        <h2 class="caps">Bridging Communities</h3>
        <p>A web built for everyone requires us all to get involved. Redecentralize creates space for communities to share their knowledge, learn from each other and celebrate successes. We bring people together to work on common challenges and build open infrastructures that promote interoperable services. We help existing solutions gain mainstream attention and help define how we measure progress to the goals and objectives of decentralization.</p>

        <h3 class="caps">Autonomy</h3>
        <p class="">Data &amp; technology should enhance our ability to make informed and un-coerced decisions, on both an individual and organisational level. It should respect our personal and collective privacy. </p>
