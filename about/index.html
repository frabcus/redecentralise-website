    <h1>What is redecentralization?</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      We’re at the start of a new information revolution.
      The last one was the printing press.
    </p>

    <p>
      It <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright#History">took centuries</a>
      for us to work out how to use print fairly. Concepts like copyright, the
      novel and libraries were formed, which we all take for granted now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although it seems like lots has happened... personal computers, the world
      wide web, smart phones… Really, it’s only just begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original Internet was decentralized. Anyone could set up parts of it.
      That’s why it won.
    </p>
    <p>
      For various reasons, control of our information technologies is
      increasingly falling into a few hands. Some big companies and Governments.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>We want it to become decentralized. Again.</b>
    </p>

    <h2>Why should anyone care?</h2>
    <p>
      Motivations for decentralizing the internet vary. These three keep coming up:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Resilient</strong> - whether there’s a hurricane, a severed
        trans-atlantic cable or just a train line with a poor connection, we’d
        like to be able to carry on making phone calls and sharing documents.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Private</strong> - as a company keeping our commercial secrets,
        or as an individual concerned about criminals and overreaching
        governments, we'd like our most personal messages not to be held in
        distant data centres.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Competitive</strong> - we're often forced to use one dominant
        provider who restricts competition, we'd like to build communtities
        around new protocols, driving innovation of new services on top.
      </li>
    </ol>
