Redecentralize Digest — February 2020
=====================================

Friends,

We have finally updated [our website](https://redecentralize.org)! An early spring cleaning of the cobwebs and archiving old material, and new content on the home and ‘about’ page. We are feeling proud :D

Have a look, tell a friend, and better still, if there's something you’d like to do within the Redecentralize umbrella that supports autonomy, privacy and choice then let us know. We're especially interested in partner projects and people wanting to run meetups/events.

In the meantime, happy March and enjoy our Febuary re-digest.

Ira & Gerben


## FOSDEM happened

Thousands of free software developers spent a weekend in Brussels. So [many interesting talks][], often technically in-depth, most (all?) of them recorded. Especially relevant was the [Decentralized Internet and Privacy devroom](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/decentralized_internet_and_privacy/).

A few picks:
- [Scion][] was presented both in a [short][] and a [long][] talk; it is a more secure internet architecture that replaces [BGP][] and lets clients choose their packet routes.
- [Matrix][] drew crowds, once talking about making it [end-to-end encrypted][] (almost ready), once about making it [peer-to-peer][] instead of [federated][] (work in progress).
- A [talk about fediverse][] concentration, moderation and privacy issues. Its concluding [appeal][]: *“If you make a fediverse tool, please make content **not indexable** by default”*
- “[State of the Onion][]”, [Tor Project][]’s review of the year.
- [HTTP/3 QUIC overview][]; Initially an upgrade for [HTTP][], QUIC is likely to more widely replace [TLS+TCP][], merging their features into one while reducing the number of round trips required for a connection. Its finalisation is still ‘a couple months away’, just like last year.

## Our Networks 2019 talks online

[Recorded talks][] from the [Our Networks][] conference (last September in Toronto) are now online. Many talks look worth watching (but I did not yet get around to that so I will not highlight any).

It has just been [announced][] that Our Networks 2020 will be on 7–9 August.

## New publications about big tech
Two English-language publications launched this month, both US-b(i)ased:

- [The Markup][]: A not-for-profit newsroom with a scientific approach (e.g. sharing their methods and data sets), and decent enough to not try track its readers. Tagline: *“Big Tech Is Watching You. We’re Watching Big Tech.”*
- [Protocol][]: a sibling of [Politico][] that focusses on the tech industry.

## Ted Nelson’s 2020 vision

Spotted in his book Literary Machines (~1980):

> THE 2020 VISION
>
> Forty years from now (if the human
> species survives), there will be hundreds of
> thousands of file servers--machines storing
> and dishing out materials. And there will be
> hundreds of millions of simultaneous users,
> able to read from billions of stored
> documents, with trillions of links among them.
>
> All of this is manifest destiny. There
> is no point in arguing it; either you see it or
> you don’t. Many readers will choke and
> fling down the book, only to have the
> thought gnaw gradually until they see its
> inevitability.
>
> The system proposed in this book may
> or may not work technically on such a scale.
> But some system of this type will, and can
> bring a Golden Age to the human mind.

I am not sure about the *“trillions of links”*, but the other numbers seem easily met. The public World Wide Web (not [Xanadu][], sorry Ted) is [estimated][] to contain at least 60 billion pages — even if most are unlikely to help *“bring a Golden Age to the human mind”*. To appreciate this foresight, perhaps try to estimate the use and scale of, say, brain-computer interaction in 2060?

[Librelounge episode #32][] with Frank Karlitschek of [NextCloud][]; talks about the fork of [OwnCloud][] into NextCloud, fully open source business models and their incentives, and how the pay-for-support model gets undermined as enterprises stop hosting on-premise.

European right to private life [does not block][edri1] obligations to identify phone users; only one of seven [ECtHR][] judges defended the right to buy anonymous SIM cards. Though in Romania, such an obligation was [found unconstitutional][edri2], again.

## About this digest

The [Redecentralize Digest](https://redecentralize.org/redigest/) is a monthly publication about internet (re)decentralisation. It covers progress and thoughts relating technology and politics, without ties to a particular project nor to one definition of decentralisation — figuring out its meanings and relations is part of the mission.

This edition was written by Gerben & Ira.

The digest’s format and content are not set in stone. Feedback and suggestions for next editions are welcome at <hello@redecentralize.org>. We don’t spy on our readers, so please do [tell us what you think](mailto:hello@redecentralize.org?subject=ReDigest%20feedback&body=I%20find%20ReDigest%20_____.%20It%20would%20be%20(even)%20better%20if%20_____.)!
