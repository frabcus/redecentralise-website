Redecentralize Digest — May 2021
================================

In this digest:

- [DWeb meetup](#dweb-meetup-today) (today!)
- [Reimagining the Internet](#reimagining-the-internet-for-the-public)
- [Matrix Spaces](#matrix-spaces)
- [Misc tips & updates](#miscellaneous) and [events coming up](#events)


## DWeb meetup today

Let’s start with this, before it’s over: Today-ish (3 June 0:00 UTC) another [DWeb meetup][] takes place, this time with Nathan Schneider talking about the *[exit to community][]* concept. Nathan’s focus is on distributed ownership, rather than the distributed design, of technology; in [his words][]:

> “For too long, we have hoped that distributed technology would produce distributed power. Again and again, the tech alone doesn’t cut it. The web won’t be truly distributed until the wealth it creates is.”

Besides this talk there will be several lightning talks about decentralisation-related projects, such as [Matters][], [Social Roots][], and [Hyper Hyper Space][]. Enjoy!

[Social Roots]: https://www.socialroots.io/ "Social Roots is “a worker-owned platform cooperative that weaves together impact driven networks”"
[Hyper Hyper Space]: https://www.hyperhyperspace.org/ "Hyper Hyper Space is “an open-source, non-for-profit effort to create distributed applications using web browsers as full peers”"


## Reimagining the internet, for the public

At the [Reimagine the Internet][] conference of the Knight First Amendment institute, Ethan Zuckerman and friends discussed the importance of and opportunities for internet services that are not (only) run by big tech corporations and surveillance capitalism: *[“The internet is too important to leave up to the market”]*

For social media, Ethan promotes the bright idea to think in terms of [“governance, not moderation”], aiming for smaller self-governing communities rather than single world-wide platform policies; more like the [Fediverse][] (or even Reddit) than Facebook. But he also lets evelyn douek [finish][] the conference with observations about the trend towards *more centralisation* in the pursuit of effective content moderation.

Ethan’s overarching theme of creating *“Digital Public Infrastructure”* (see also [November’s digest][]) seems part of a wider trend, with *“Public …”* themes appearing everywhere: *[Public Interest Technology][]*, *[Public Service Internet][]*, *([Digital][]) [Public Spaces][]*, *[Public Stack][]*, *[Shared Digital European Public Sphere][]*, and EFF’s latest introduction of the *[Public Interest Internet][]*.

These similar (sometimes synonymous) themes all overlap with the goals of decentralisation, and usually go hand-in-hand. This makes me wonder how to see the relation between these two angles of ‘public’ and ‘decentralised’. Perhaps we should take care to give both angles attention, to ensure that decentralisation efforts indeed benefit the public, and that public interest projects don’t end up creating a centralised [“Statebook”][].

## Matrix Spaces

The [Matrix][] chat protocol has been developing steadily. The latest introduction is the ‘[Spaces][]’ concept, which enables grouping chat rooms. A bit like you may know from e.g. Mattermost/Slack/etc, but more versatile: rooms can appear in multiple spaces, spaces can be nested in a hierarchy, and more features are to follow (technically, a space is itself a ‘room of rooms’).

A beta-version of spaces can be [tried in Element][], the flagship Matrix app. Perhaps we will soon turn our [#redecentralize chat room][]  into a space too! (come join us already, if you are not there yet)

[Matrix][] also revealed its [Pinecone overlay network][] as a first step in the move from federated to peer-to-peer networking.

- After three years of [GDPR][], the European Data Protection Supervisor aptly [calls][] it *“a three-year-old who must still learn to walk”*, and the EU Parliament [called][] the Commission to take action against Ireland’s lack of enforcement to the tech giants based there.

## About this digest

The [Redecentralize Digest](https://redecentralize.org/redigest/) is a monthly publication about internet (re)decentralisation. It covers progress and thoughts relating technology and politics, without ties to a particular project nor to one definition of decentralisation — figuring out its meanings and relations is part of the mission.

This edition was written by Gerben, with thanks for all tips & suggestions.

The digest’s format and content are not set in stone. Feedback, corrections and suggestions for next editions are welcome at <hello@redecentralize.org>.
