# IndieWeb Decentralized Standards and Methods

*Below are notes extracted from the etherpad for this session (held at [Redecentralize 2019](https://redecentralize.org/events/2019-conference/))*


### Session Title: IndieWeb Decentralized Standards and Methods

### Called by: Kevin Marks

*See also Tantekâ€™s write-up about this session: <https://tantek.com/2019/301/b1/redecentralize-indieweb-standards-methods>*


### What Happened?

Discussed specifications, tools, services linked from:

<https://tantek.com/2019/298/t1/lightning-talk-redecentralize-rdc19>

Demonstrated how to check your site with <https://indiewebify.me/> for your h-card, and h-entry


Also showed & discussed:

<https://microformats.io/> as a way to check your markup and the JSON output

<https://spec.indieweb.org/> overview of specifications

e.g. <https://Micropub.rocks> test suite, and living editor's draft: <https://micropub.net/draft/>


Dove into indie web events a bit more and RSVPs.

Kevin live RSVPd to the event that I'd shown
<http://known.kevinmarks.com/2019/no-but-i-do-miss-it>
viewed source on that and walked through the markup
ran it through microformats.io to show the resulting JSON


And IndieAuth: <https://indieauth.net/>

Demonstrated:
<https://indielogin.com/setup>

and logging into <https://indieweb.org/> with <https://tantek.com/> via GitHub rel=me


How do I add a new way to authenticate, like SecureScuttleButt?

Make an IndieAuth provider that handles SSB authentication.
See the specification:
<https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/>

But first read Aaron's article on "OAuth for the Open Web"

How reading works on the IndieWeb

Microsub standard
<https://indieweb.org/Microsub>

showed signing into:
<https://aperture.p3k.io/>

adding a subscription:
<http://known.kevinmarks.com/>

reading feeds:
<https://monocle.p3k.io/>


Does this work with static sites?

Yes! See:

<https://indieweb.org/static_site_cms>

<https://indieweb.org/static_site_generator>

E.g. <http://www.kevinmarks.com/> uses Heroku Webmention App to display likes etc. in the footer


How do you do updates and deletes with Webmentions?
