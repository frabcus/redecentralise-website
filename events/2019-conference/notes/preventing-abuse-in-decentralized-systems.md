# Preventing abuse in decentralized systems

*Below are notes extracted from the etherpad for this session (held at [Redecentralize 2019](https://redecentralize.org/events/2019-conference/))*


### Session Title: Preventing abuse in decentralized networks

### Called by: Doug Belshaw

<https://moodle.com/moodlenet>

### What Happened?
- Discussed the problem of Gab in the Fediverse: <https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20691957/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-gab-migration-fediverse-app-blocking>
- Broke into three groups:
	- **Technical**
		- How do you have a world which is both anonymous, but leads to consequences if you do something (e.g.) illegal?
		- Decentralised identity (liability)
			- What would happen if someone didn't want to do that?
			- How do we make (criminal) liability possible?
		- Micropayments as a way of adding friction into the system
	- **Philosophical**
		- Discussed how communities are run offline and how this doesn't (or does)
		- Mastodon not really 'decentralised' because admins have access to data and provide access to it
			- Boils down to issues around trust
	- **UX**
		- We're using old patterns for new problem (or at least in terms of implications)
			- Learning from cities which have abusive behaviours and have to deal with them
			- Book (trilogy) "A Pattern Language" by Christopher Alexander
				- Thinking about, for example, T-junctions and reducing accidents
		- Some people move away from abuse, some people actively look for places to inflict it
		- SSB project - framed moderation around "freedom of listening" <https://www.scuttlebutt.nz>
			- No admins, but a form of moderation in the sense as being based on friends and friends of friends (auto-blocking, delegating blocking?)
		- Shared online blocklists? c.f. Blokada: <https://blokada.org>
		- Technology as a tool to solve certain types of problems, but the solution to abuse is unlkely to just be technical (too much is led by what technology -can- do rather than what it should)
		- Shadowbanning and online/offline differences (what do we do online that we could never do offline?)
		- Design doesn't have to be neutral - we can make people (e.g. the alt-right) not want to come into spaces we are
		- The internet as a mirror of a very specific type of society (when there's so much diversity in the world)
			- Decentralised vs centralisation in terms of cities (where more demands than resources)
			- One of the first questions to ask when setting up a community should be "am I setting up a village or a city?"
		- Cell-like structure where 'pubs' (c.f. SSB) can be cut off - still exist, but not visible
		- Run your own social - <https://runyourown.social> ("social networks should not have more than 50 people")
		- In smaller communities, things get sorted out more naturally (e.g. village pub) but in larger ones more formalised (e.g. city pub)
		- Levels to organising (e.g. Carnival in Brazil - big ones, but also small ones)

### Next Actions: By When, By Whom?:
- Sunday aftern 16:00 - Remixing UX Patterns for Decentralisation
- Read a recommended book (Christopher Alexander - 'A Pattern Language')
- Write up what happened when members of the alt-right joined SSB
