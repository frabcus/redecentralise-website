### Session Title: UX Patterns for decentralization

### Called by: Eileen

<https://whimsical.com/PWXi35G9fKEW7ZTjCQrKmd>

### Who Came?:

People are interested in learning: how to avoid bad UX because of strong consequences, how to guide users through tasks, how humans interact with software, how to make people care; UX questions for specfic projects; how to make highly complex systems more simple for users; how to make interfaces for contracts manageable for non-lawyers;  what UX can mean in a decentralized space; interest in design


### What Happened?
- Eileen: people solving design problems independent from each other, also in the decentralized space.
- Do people need to know that it's decentralized?
- How to approach UX in general? What are the steps? How to do user research? How do I do synthesis?
- How (and whether) to explain the difference between protocol and client
- Reasons for decentralization very diverse: explaining to people why to decentralize
- Q: Is there any exisiting framework for UX in the decentralized space? A: Not as far as I know.
- Eileen showing the Whimsical overiew of UX questions around decentralization. Forexample， Mentalmodels， privacy

assignments
- browser plugin for managing identity
- sneakernet / archive)
- chat app



Identity:
    What is an identity? Can someone have multiple identities?
    What is an accessible way of talking about it? (Containers)
    Mirror
    Managing identity
    Tracking protection


Sneakernet
- if you want to share information but not be caught having that information. And how can people verify that the information really came from you
- can you trust your mobile phone?
- screen: with a dongle connected; beacon to broadcast? [We don't trust our phones enough for it to b the one to carry the information, but also not wanting to have a separate device that would make you suspicious to authorities]


Peer 2 Peer Messenger App
    What are basic elements? Add people.
    Discover new users? QR code
    Find by community!
    Sharing of contacts/trust
    Client implementation doesn't have to match the protocol; there can be reduced complexity in the client.
