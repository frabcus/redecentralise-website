==========================

This is the code for the website of [redecentralize.org](https://redecentralize.org).

Setting up local development
============================

The website is made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which converts simple
templates into static HTML files. Github supports it automatically, so this
keeps things simple.

To view edits on your local machine, follow [these
instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).
